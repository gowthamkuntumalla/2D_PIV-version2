/***OPENCV LIBRARY IS A MUST FOR THIS SOFTWARE***/

It contains FFT based cross correlation function.Much faster than direct correlation in spacial domain.
The software takes in a image pair,the size of the interrogation area(window size) and the step-size(distance between two vectors)-all in number of pixels and gives a velocity vector plot along with a text document with the co-ordinates of the starting and the ending points of the velocity vector.
The velocity is obtained upto a sub-pixel accuracy using "Peak centroid" method.
Analysis of each image pair takes about 3 seconds(on average for different image sizes).
